# ExactScript
### ExactScript documents programming languages, frameworks, commands, APIs (...) with the consistency of a programming language.

ExactScript's goal is to be simple, opaque, precise, and consumable.

- All user facing elements in exactscript are exactly as you would expect.

- All elements on all exactscript pages are displayed in consistent order, style, and layout.

- Creations or edits of exactscript pages must:
  - descend from a core ExactScript Topic
  - be the most current information available
  - reference a canonical source of documentation
  - be approved by 10 other users from separate IP addresses
  
- Users can be banned by me or 10 other users.

- Up to 5 ads appear in a single position on every page and are bid on by users monthly.

ExactScript is inspired by Wikipedia, Golang, Unix, Linux, Oxford Very Short Introductions, Apple's human interface rigidity (not looking too good right now boys), Microsoft's recent acute awareness of developer pain points (TypeScript, WSL, CLR -- embrace extend extinguish), and the band Tool.

ExactScript source code and design guidelines are open source and have no restrictions for use in either (1) private or (2) derivative and non-competing use.[why?]  Following my death, ExactScript's source code and design guidelines may henceforth be used in a competing service.
